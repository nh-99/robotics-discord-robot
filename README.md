# Robotics Discord Bot

A discord bot that handles some simple functions. Currently supports:
- Notifying channel of new TikTok videos
- Notifying channel of new Youtube videos
- ChatGPT-powered responses to @ messages (with the personality of Bob Ross, for the use case of my bot)
- A `/paint` command that uses OpenAI image & chat API's to paint a picture like Bob Ross.
